# Layer 2 Rollups and Subnetworks

Rollups are Layer 2 solutions dominating Ethereum scaling and have been gaining a great popularity in many networks like Syscoin, Cosmos, and many specific projects like Immutable X, zkSync, StarkWare, Loopring, etc.

There are two types of rollups: optimistic rollups(optimism project) and zk-rollups (zksyncs project). Oraichain has customized these both types in its modules when implementing subnetworks for AI Oracles and OraiDEX.&#x20;

The purpose of running subnetworks & Layer 2 rollups adaptations on Oraichain is separating the Mainnet and subnetworks is to scale up the performance of the Mainnet, also known as the Layer 1.

Subnetworks such as Oracle networks or VRF service will stay in Layer 2 and Oraichain can implement Layer 2 solutions to expand the capacity of Mainnet while not affecting the core logic and security of the Mainnet.
