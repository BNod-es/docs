# Delegate Tokens To A Validator

In the view of Oraichain’s **Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)** consensus protocol, the network will consist of numerous validators that require ORAI tokens to run nodes, while other ORAI token holders can be delegators by staking their tokens to validators and get shared rewards for each newly created block.

Over the course of using **Oraiscan**, ORAI token holders can start delegating ORAI tokens to any qualified validators on the Oraichain Network.

**Reminder:** Prior to the delegation, make sure that you’ve already got an Oraichain account on Oraiscan as well as sufficient ORAI tokens.

**Step 1:** Visit [**https://scan.orai.io/**](https://scan.orai.io) and log into your account via **Connect Wallet**.

**Step 2:** Navigate to the **Validator** section, in which you can see a list of validators assigned by Oraichain.
